<h2 class="u-title">Hello, ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>My name is Steffen, and I work with the interwebs ðŸ’»</p>

<p>It is important to keep up to date with the latest knowledge. I think this is best achieved through group dynamics and
    passion. That is why web development appeals to me. There is always something new to learn. In addition, you are rewarded
    with visual results. This is a great motivation for me.</p>

<p>You can read my thoughts about the interwebs <a class="c-link" href="/blog">here</a>.</p>
