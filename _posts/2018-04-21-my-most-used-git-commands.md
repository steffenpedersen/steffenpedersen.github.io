This is not a full guide to which commands you should learn. I just find it inspiring to read about other developers’ habits and work routines. This I would like to contribute to and tell about my most used Git commands.

I honestly don’t have a specific way on typing these commands. I sometimes write the full command. I sometimes replace git with g. And then I sometimes write the full alias. I think it depends on the goal with the command. It is worth mentioning that I am using ZSH with oh-my-zsh.
