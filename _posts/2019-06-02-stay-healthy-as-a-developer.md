This is a personal guide for staying healthy. It is by no means an official guide, and I am by no means an instructor or trained to teach in this field.

I started working full time as a developer a few years ago. Since then, I have become more weak and have got a small belly. I have seen several of my colleagues getting back problems. I do not want that! I will in this simple personal guide show a training program, calorie intake and a meal plan. I hope this can inspire a few developers to start getting healthy habits.
